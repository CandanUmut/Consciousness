PHASE 0  ·  Bench-calibrate your instruments  (Week 1)

Step	Action	Why
0-A	Stream EEG into Python via BrainFlow (or the vendor SDK → Lab Streaming Layer). Log at least 500 Hz.	Uniform API, fast plotting, easy to add sensors later.  ￼ ￼
0-B	Add environment channels: Schumann-band loop-antenna (7.8–45 Hz), a low-noise Hall probe (DC–1 kHz), and a Zener RNG USB stick.	Gives you brain, field, and randomness in one time-base.  ￼ ￼
0-C	Sync all clocks to NTP/GPS at sub-millisecond accuracy.	Needed for later multi-site and RNG comparisons.
0-D	Run 10-min eyes-closed rest and eyes-open recordings; verify canonical alpha suppression and no 50/60 Hz mains bleed.	Sanity check.

Checkpoint 0: Clean alpha & Schumann lines visible?  If yes → Phase 1.

PHASE 1  ·  Detect personal coherence bursts  (Weeks 2–4)
	1.	Design two inner states you can enter on demand
e.g. deep breath-paced focus vs. mind-wandering.
	2.	Record 30 trials per state (2 min each).
Use a “section marker” keystroke when the subjective state change begins.
	3.	Analysis
	•	Compute cross-spectral coherence between EEG posterior hot-zone leads and local ELF antenna for 0–50 Hz windows.
	•	Track RNG variance in the same 5-sec epochs.
	4.	Hypothesis test
Coherence(Brain↔ELF) and ↓RNG entropy are higher during focus than mind-wandering.
	5.	If p < 0.01 with ≥0.3 effect size, move on; if not, iterate shielding or state protocol.

PHASE 2  ·  Causal entrainment pilot  (Weeks 5–8)

Modality	Parameters	Safety notes
tACS	500 µA peak-to-peak sine at your Phase 1 “golden frequency” (often 7–8 Hz or 40 Hz).	Keep density < 0.05 mA cm⁻², use saline sponge electrodes.
Vibro-acoustic driver	Put a 30 W tactile transducer on sternum or back; sweep 20–120 Hz; amplitude < 1 g.	Body-safe; avoid pacemakers.
Near-field EM coil	1–5 mT, 1–100 Hz saw/tri, 30 cm loop, < 15 min.	Limit dB/dt to ICNIRP guidelines.

Protocol
	1.	Randomize sham vs. real stimulation blocks; double-blind using Python script.
	2.	Measure EEG-ELF-RNG coherence as before.
	3.	Look for dose-response: stronger entrainment → larger coherence & RNG shift.

Checkpoint 2: Significant, reversible modulation?  If yes, you’ve causally nudged the putative field—move to shared-mind tests.

PHASE 3  ·  Two-site resonance experiment  (Quarter 2)
	1.	Ship a clone rig (EEG + ELF + RNG) to a trusted collaborator 500 + km away.
	2.	Plan 40 sessions where you both enter the Phase 1 focus state at pre-agreed UTC slots; half the sessions one partner also receives the Phase 2 tACS at “golden f”.
	3.	Blind-analyze inter-site coherence (Brain¹ ↔ Brain², Brain ↔ ELF², RNG¹+²) with shuffled-label controls.
	4.	Pre-register and upload raw data to a public IPFS CID so outsiders can verify.

PHASE 4  ·  Open network & “Reality Dashboard”  (Year 1)

Hardware: When budgets allow, add 16-sensor wearable OPM-MEG modules for fT-level field mapping; market cost now <$30 k per 16-set and falling  ￼ ￼ ￼.

Software stack (all MIT or MPL-2.0):

Layer	Tool
Acquisition	BrainFlow + LSL for every site
Storage	MongoDB (local) → daily IPFS pin
Analytics	Jupyter pipelines (NumPy, MNE-Python, PyRNG)
Visual	Grafana “Reality Dashboard”: live brain-field-RNG coherence world-map
Governance	Open Collective; replicated Git repo with signed commits



⸻

Immediate TODO checklist (this weekend)
	•	Install BrainFlow Python bindings and confirm EEG stream.
	•	Wind six-turn 1 m copper loop, plug into audio interface as ELF antenna.
	•	Order two TrueRNGpro USB sticks and run entropy monitor script.
	•	Build Phase 1 notebook (template pushed to GitHub repo consciousness-radio/phase1).

Why this “receiver–transformer” model matches your theory

Brains ≈ adaptive transformers that impedance-match primordial mind-information into biochemical patterns; stimulation is an attempt to perturb that matching layer and watch how the universal substrate (RNG / ELF noise) responds.  Each phase refines the coupling constant between internal state → local field → global randomness, giving a concrete handle on what was once purely metaphysical.

If at any checkpoint the effect collapses under blinded controls, you’ve still built:
	1.	A high-grade open-source neurofeedback rig.
	2.	A local Schumann & RNG observatory linked to the Global Consciousness Project data stream.
	3.	A reproducible dataset others can mine, strengthening or falsifying the hypothesis.

Either way, knowledge—and tools—advance.  Ready to spin up Phase 0?
